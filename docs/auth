with the JWT bearer token, list your installations and note the installation id for your app
$ curl -i \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
-H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
https://api.github.com/app/installations

then get an installation access token for the above id

to get installations for a specific repo use 
https://api.github.com/repos/AndrewKovalenko/lotogen/installation


$ curl -i -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
-H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
https://api.github.com/app/installations/:installation_id/access_tokens
then with that token create the check run but use "Authorization: token" header curl -i -H "Authorization: token YOUR_INSTALLATION_ACCESS_TOKEN"
