with the JWT bearer token, list your installations and note the installation id for your app
$ 
then get an installation access token for the above id

to get installations for a specific repo use 
https://api.github.com/repos/AndrewKovalenko/lotogen/installation


$ then with that token create the check run but use "Authorization: token" header curl -i -H "Authorization: token YOUR_INSTALLATION_ACCESS_TOKEN"
